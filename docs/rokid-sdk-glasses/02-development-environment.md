# Development Environment

## Enable ADB

When using the Rokid CXR-S SDK, you need to enable ADB on Rokid Glasses through the Rokid AI APP.

## Use a Dedicated Development Cable

The magnetic charging port on Rokid Glasses can also function as a data port. A specialized development cable is required for this purpose.

> **Tips:** The product purchased by default only includes a charging cable. If you need a development cable, please contact the developer assistant.
